Abstract— Drivers who do not take regular breaks when 
driving long distances run a high risk of becoming  drowsy a 
state which they often fail to recognize early enough according 
to the experts. Studies show that around one quarter of all 
serious motorway accidents are at tributable to sleepy drivers 
in need of a rest, meaning th at drowsiness causes more road 
accidents than drink-driving. Attention assist can warn of 
inattentiveness and drowsiness in an extended speed range and

accidents than drink-driving. Attention assist can warn of 
inattentiveness and drowsiness in an extended speed range and 
notify drivers of their current state of fatigue and the driving 
time since the last break, offers adjustable sensitivity and, if a 
warning is emitted, indicates nearby service areas in the 
COMAND navigation system.

I. INTRODUCTION 
    Driver drowsiness detecti on is a car safety technology 
which prevents accidents when the driver is getting drowsy.   
Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road 
accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads. 
Driver fatigue is a significant factor in a large number of 
vehicle accidents. Recent statistics estimate that annually 
1,200 deaths and 76,000 injuries can be attributed to fatigue

vehicle accidents. Recent statistics estimate that annually 
1,200 deaths and 76,000 injuries can be attributed to fatigue 
related crashes. The development of technologies for 
detecting or preventing drowsiness at the wheel is a major 
challenge in the field of accident avoidance systems. 
Because of the hazard that drow siness presents on the road, 
methods need to be developed for counteracting its affects. 
Driver inattention might be the result of a lack of alertness 
when driving due to driver drowsiness and distraction. 
Driver distraction occurs when  an object or event draws a 
person’s attention away from the driving task. Unlike driver 
distraction, driver drowsiness involves no triggering event 
but, instead, is characterized by a progressive withdrawal of 
attention from the road and traffic demands. Both driver 
drowsiness and distraction, however, might have the same

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 4 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=0
attention from the road and traffic demands. Both driver 
drowsiness and distraction, however, might have the same 
effects, i.e., decreased drivin g performance, longer reaction 
time, and an increased risk of crash involvement. [1]. 
“Fig.1”, shows the block diagram of overall system. Based 
on Acquisition of  video from the camera that is in front of 
driver perform real-time processing of an incoming video 
stream in order to infer the driver’s level of fatigue if the 
drowsiness is Estimated then the output is send to the alarm 
system and alarm is activated

II. FACTORS CAUSING DRIVING DROWSINESS 
Driver Fatigue is often caused by  four main factors: sleep, 
work, time of day, and physical. Often people try to do 
much in a day and they lose precious sleep due to this. 
Often by taking caffeine or other stimulants people continue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 5 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=0
much in a day and they lose precious sleep due to this. 
Often by taking caffeine or other stimulants people continue 
to stay awake. The lack of sleep builds up over a number of 
days and the next thing that happens is the body finally 
collapses and The person falls asleep. Time of day factors 
can often affect the body. The human brain is trained to 
think there are times the body should be asleep. These are 
often associated with seeing the sunrise and sunset. 
Between the hours of 2 AM and 6 AM, the brain tells the 
body it should be asleep.  
Extending the time awake will eventually lead to the body 
crashing. The final factor is a person’s physical condition. 
People sometimes are on medications that create 
drowsiness or have physical ailments that cause these issues. 
Being physically unfit, by being either under or overweight,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 6 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=0
drowsiness or have physical ailments that cause these issues. 
Being physically unfit, by being either under or overweight, 
will cause fatigue. Additionally, being emotionally stressed 
will cause the body to get fatigued quicker [3] 
III. RELATED STUDY 
Drowsiness detection can be divided into three main 
categories (1) Vehicle based (2) Behavioural based (3) 
Physiological based. [4]”Fig.2”, shows the three different 
approaches for drowsiness detection. Drowsiness detection 
is based on these three parameters. A detailed review on 
these measures will provide insight on the present systems, 
issues associated with them and the enhancements that need 
to be done to make a robust system.  
Vehicle based measures:  A number of metrics, including 
deviations from lane position, movement of the steering 
wheel, pressure on the accel eration pedal, etc., are

constantly  monitored  and any change in these that crosses 
a specified threshold indicate s a significantly increased 
probability that the driver is drowsy. 
 
Fig.2. Different Approaches for Drowsiness Detection and Warnings [4] 
 
Behavioural based measures:  The behaviour of the driver, 
including yawning, eye closure, eye blinking, head pose,   
etc.  
is monitored through a camera an d the driver is alerted if 
any of these drowsiness symptoms are detected. 
Physiological based measures: The correlation between 
physiological signals ECG (Electrocardiogram) and EOG 
(Electrooculogram).  Drowsiness is detected through pulse 
rate, heart beat and brain information.

Drowsiness detection system, most of them using ECG, 
Vehicle Based approaches.A robust real- time embedded 
platform to monitor the loss of attention of the driver during 
day and night driving conditions. [5] A drowsiness 
detection system using both brain and visual activity is 
presented in this paper. The brain activity is monitored 
using a single electroencephalographic (EEG) channel.[6] A 
method to monitor driver safety by analyzing information 
related to fatigue using two distinct methods: eye 
movement monitoring and bio-signal processing. A 
monitoring system is designed in Android-based 
Smartphone. [7] A support vector machine (SVM) classifies 
a sequence of video segments into alert or non alert driving 
events. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme 
offers high classiﬁcation accuracy [8]. The aim of this paper

events. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme 
offers high classiﬁcation accuracy [8]. The aim of this paper 
is to maximize the amount of drowsiness-related 
information extracted from a set of electroencephalogram 
(EEG), electrooculogram    (EOG),   and     
electrocardiogram   (ECG) 
Signals during a simulation driving test.[9]  The system is a 
software prototype of this system in vehicles, where images 
that are captured will be processed using image processing 
techniques and accordingly issue warning.[10] A robust eye 
detection algorithm is introduced to address the problems 
caused by changes in illumination and driver posture. Six 
measures are calculated with pe rcentage of eyelid closure, 
maximum closure duration, an d blink frequency, average 
opening level of the eyes, opening velocity of the eyes, and 
closing velocity of the eyes.[11]

opening level of the eyes, opening velocity of the eyes, and 
closing velocity of the eyes.[11] 
V. DROWSINESS DETECTION TECHNIQUES 
    If car technologies are go ing to prevent or at least warn 
of driver fatigue, what symptoms does the driver give off 
that can be detected?  According to research, there are 
multiple categories of technologies that can detect driver 
fatigue. The first is the use of cameras to monitor a person’s 
behaviour. This includes monitoring their pupils, mouth for 
yawning, head position, and a variety of other factors. The 
next of these technologies is voice recognition. Often a 
person’s voice can give off clues on how fatigued they are.  
The detail explanation of the underlying techniques of 
drowsiness detection that are mostly used for the detection 
purpose: 
• ECG and EEG 
• LBP (Local Binary Pattern) 
• Steering Wheel Movement (SWM)

drowsiness detection that are mostly used for the detection 
purpose: 
• ECG and EEG 
• LBP (Local Binary Pattern) 
• Steering Wheel Movement (SWM) 
• Optical Detection 
 
A. ECG and EEG 
   Many researchers have considered the following 
physiological signals to detect drowsiness: 
electrocardiogram (ECG), el ectroencephalogram (EEG). 
The heart rate (HR) also varies significantly between the 
different stages of drowsiness, such as alertness and fatigue. 
Therefore, heart rate, which can be easily determined by the 
ECG signal, can also be used to detect drowsiness. Others 
have measured drowsiness using Heart Rate Variability 
(HRV), in which the low (LF) and high (HF) frequencies 
fall in the range of 0.04–0.15 Hz and 0.14–0.4 [12]” Fig.3”, 
shows physiological signal  sensing system that can be 
integrated into vehicles to detect driver drowsiness.

shows physiological signal  sensing system that can be 
integrated into vehicles to detect driver drowsiness. 
Fig.3. Schematic of Sensing System Integration for Driver Drowsiness 
Detection and Assistance [13] 
 
The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the physiological 
signal most commonly used to measure drowsiness. The 
EEG signal has various frequency bands, including the 
delta band (0.5–4 Hz), which corresponds to sleep activity, 
the theta band (4–8 Hz), which is related to drowsiness, the 
alpha band (8–13 Hz), which represents relaxation and 
creativity, and the beta band (13–25 Hz), which 
corresponds to aler tness . A decrease in  the power changes 
in the alpha frequency band an d an increase in the theta 
frequency band indicates drowsiness.

B.  LBP (local binary pattern) 
  Local binary patterns (LBPs) have aroused increasing 
interest in image processing and computer vision. As a 
nonparametric method, LBP summarizes local structures of 
images efficiently by comparing each pixel with its 
neighbouring pixels. The most important properties of LBP 
are its tolerance regarding monotonic illumination changes 
and its computational simplicity. This technique is mostly 
used for detecting emotions on the face like, happiness, 
sadness, excitement etc. LBP (local binary pattern) is used 
in drowsiness detection for detecting face of the driver, it 
divides the image into four quadrants then the top and 
bottom part are detected.”Fig.4”, shows LBP extract the 
image from the video then the image is divided into blocks, 
after that LBP histogram are generated from the each block

image from the video then the image is divided into blocks, 
after that LBP histogram are generated from the each block 
and feature histograms are fo rmed[14] Figure Shows the 
LBP technique. 
 
Fig. 4.  Local Binary pattern [14] 
C.  Steering Wheel Movement (SWM)  
  Measured using steering angle sensor and it is a widely 
used vehicle-based measure for detecting the level of driver 
drowsiness. Using an angle sensor mounted on the steering 
column, the driver’s steering behaviour is measured. When 
drowsy, the number of micro-corrections on the steering 
wheel reduces compared to no rmal driving. Furlough and 
Graham found that sleep deprived drivers made fewer 
steering wheel reversals than normal drivers .To eliminate 
the effect of lane changes, the researchers considered only 
small steering wheel movements (between 0.5° and 5°),

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 17 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=2
the effect of lane changes, the researchers considered only 
small steering wheel movements (between 0.5° and 5°), 
which are needed to adjust the lateral position within the 
lane .”Fig.5” shows the SWM based detection. In general, 
steering behavior is influenced by characteristics of the 
driving task (e.g. speed, curvature, and lane width), driver 
traits (e.g. driving experience), and driver states (e.g. 
laxness, distraction or fatigue). Drivers are constantly 
judging the situation ahead and applying small, smooth, 
steering adjustments to correc t for small road bumps and 
crosswinds by turning the steering wheel in small 
increments. 
  
Fig.5. Steering Movement Based Detection [15] 
Hence, based on small SWMs, it is possible to determine 
the drowsiness state of the driv er and thus provide an alert 
if needed. In a simulated environment, light side winds that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 18 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=2
the drowsiness state of the driv er and thus provide an alert 
if needed. In a simulated environment, light side winds that 
pushed the car to the right side of the road were added 
along a curved road in order to create variations in the 
lateral position and force the drivers to make corrective 
SWMs . Car companies, such as Nissan and Renault, have 
adopted SWMs but it works in very limited situations . This 
is because they can function reliably only at particular 
environments and are too dependent on the geometric 
characteristics of the road and  to a lesser extent on the 
kinetic characteristics of the vehicle [16] 
 
D.  Optical Detection 
 The most common implementation of an optical sensor 
system uses infrared or near-infrared LEDs to light the 
driver’s pupils, which are then monitored by a camera 
system. Computer algorithms  analyse blink rate and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 19 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=2
driver’s pupils, which are then monitored by a camera 
system. Computer algorithms  analyse blink rate and 
duration to determine drowsiness.  The camera system may 
also monitor facial features and head position for signs of 
drowsiness, such as yawning and sudden head nods. 
Depicts the use of an optical detection system [17] 
 
E.  Eye Blinking Based Technique 
  In this eye blinking rate and eye closure duration is 
measured to detect driver’s  drowsiness. Because when 
driver felt sleepy at that time his/her eye blinking and gaze 
between eyelids are different from normal situations so they 
easily detect drowsiness.”Fig.6”, shows the eye blinking 
based drowsiness detection In this system the position of 
irises and eye states are monitored through time to estimate 
eye blinking frequency and eye close duration. [18]. And in 
this type of system uses a remotely placed camera to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHUNK 20 | source=.uploads/sample.pdf | page=2
eye blinking frequency and eye close duration. [18]. And in 
this type of system uses a remotely placed camera to 
acquire video and computer vision methods are then applied 
to sequentially localize face, eyes and eyelids positions to 
measure ratio of closure.[19] Using these eyes closer and 
blinking ration one can detect drowsiness of driver. Such a 
system, mounted in a discreet corner of the car, could 
monitor for any signs of the head tilting, the eyes drooping, 
or the mouth yawning simultaneously. The following figure 
shows the eye blink detection. 
 
Fig. 6. Scheme of the proposed algorithm for eye-blink detection [20] 
 
F. Yawning Based Technique 
  Detection of drives’ drowsiness based on yawning 
measurement. This involves several steps including the real 
time detection and tracking of driver’s face, detection and

measurement. This involves several steps including the real 
time detection and tracking of driver’s face, detection and 
tracking of the mouth contour and the detection “Fig.7”,

Corp. In our approach, the dr iver’s face is continuously 
captured using a video camera th at is installed under the 
front mirror inside the car, as  shown in “Fig.8”, Next, 
detecting drowsiness involves two main steps to properly 
measure changes in facial gestures that imply drowsiness.  
 
 
Fig.7. Example of Face and Mouth Contours Detection (a) 
 
  First, the driver’s face is de tected and tracked in the series 
of frame shots taken by the camera. After locating the 
driver’s face, the next step is to detect and track the location 
of the mouth.  We have chosen to detect and track the 
face prior to tracking the mouth as this makes the mouth 
tracking  procedure  more robu st against false detections. 
After detection of the mouth, the yawning state is detected 
based on measuring the rate of changes in the area of the 
mouth contour and the aspect ratio of mouth area [22].

based on measuring the rate of changes in the area of the 
mouth contour and the aspect ratio of mouth area [22].

G.  Head Nodding Detection 
Another method currently use is the Head Position 
Detection. This technology simply determines the head tilt 
angle. When the head angle goes beyond a certain angle, an 
audio alarm is transmitted in the driver’s ear. 
VI. C
ONCLUSION 
As described throughout the paper, many technologies exist 
to detect driver fatigue. This paper tries to look at the 
emerging technologies and determine the best approaches 
in trying to prevent the numb er one cause of fatal vehicle 
crashes. Currently, the number one selling product in the 
market is the market is nothing more than a reed switch to 
detect head angle tilt. This product is extremely limited and 
not very effective. The product made by BMW and

not very effective. The product made by BMW and 
integrated into their high end cars to detect driver fatigue 
behaviour is slightly more effective is detection but lack 
proper notification to warn a driver. The current market and 
technologies is in its infancy mode. New technologies keep 
emerging using different techniques.
